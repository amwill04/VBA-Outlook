# VBA Outlook Functions

Few functions that can loop over ranges within Excel to convert to HTML tables
or text lines that can be added to an email using ms Outlook.

## To use

`$ git clone https://github/amwill04/VBA-Outlook`
`Open Excel`
`Open Visual Basic in Excel`
`File > Import File...`

## Misc.

The functions are mainly for my future reference as the are currently very
specific but can be modified for person purpose.
